These reducer functions are called with each dispatched action and the current or initial state and return a new immutable state. Reducers use switch statements in combination with TypeScript's discriminated unions defined in your actions to provide type-safe processing of actions in a reducer.</p>\n<h2 id=\"\"><a title=\"Link to this heading\" class=\"header-link\" aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"guide/store/reducers#\"><i class=\"material-icons\">link</i></a></h2>\n\n</div>\n\n<!-- links to this doc:\n - guide/store\n-->\n<!-- links from this doc:\n - guide/store/reducers#\n - guide/store/reducers#reducers\n - https://github.com/ngrx/platform/edit/master/projects/ngrx.io/content/guide/store/reducers.md?message=docs%3A%20describe%20your%20change...\n-->"
